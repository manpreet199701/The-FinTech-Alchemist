                    My story isn't a straight line. It starts with a solid foundation in 
                    commerce and logistics, an academic path that took me from Delhi University 
                    to a diploma in Canada. Along the way, I gained hands-on experience in finance 
                    and banking, building a strong understanding of how the business world operates.

                    But even with that expertise, a childhood fascination with robotics never 
                    left me. That same curiosity has since evolved into a powerful drive to explore 
                    the dynamic worlds of AI, machine learning, and coding. Now, my mission is to 
                    bridge those two worlds. I'm on a journey to build a career that seamlessly 
                    blends my knowledge of financial markets—from investments 
                    to equity—with the transformative power of artificial intelligence. 
                    I believe that by combining these skills, I can create something truly unique 
                    and help innovate the future of finance.
