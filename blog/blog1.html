            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">Welcome to the start of a journey that's been years in the making. For a long time, my career has been a mix of commerce, logistics, and finance. But deep down, a childhood fascination with robotics and technology has always been bubbling. Now, I’m finally bringing those two worlds together.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">My mission is to become a FinTech Alchemist, seamlessly blending the worlds of finance and technology. This blog will be my public notebook, documenting every step of an intensive **3-month plan** designed to transform my skills and turn this passion into a profession. I'll be focusing on a few key areas: getting certified, building practical projects, and ultimately, preparing for a career at the intersection of AI and financial markets.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">I won't be sharing every tiny detail, but here’s a high-level look at the roadmap. My goal is to use this plan to earn the **AWS Certified AI Practitioner** certification and build a portfolio that truly reflects my abilities.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Phase 1: Building the Foundations (Weeks 1-4)</h2>
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">The first month is all about laying a rock-solid foundation. As I dive deep into core concepts and refresh my skills in **AWS Cloud** and **Python for data science**, I'll be sharing my journey with you. I'll also be exploring the fundamentals of **Machine Learning & AI**, with a specific focus on financial applications like risk analysis and fraud detection. For each project I build, I will not only show you the result, but I will walk you through the entire process, step-by-step, explaining how I made it and the challenges I faced. My first major deliverable will be a small data analysis project that puts these foundational skills into practice, and I'll be sure to guide you through the process as well.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Phase 2: The Capstone & The Certification (Weeks 5-7)</h2>
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">This is where the plan kicks into high gear. I'll shift from learning theory to applying it. The focus here is on a **capstone project**—a hands-on, end-to-end project that combines multiple skills, from data ingestion to model deployment on AWS. This project will be the centerpiece of my portfolio. This phase also includes focused, intense preparation for the **AWS Certified AI Practitioner** exam, with the goal of passing it by the end of week 7.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Phase 3: The Launchpad (Weeks 8-12)</h2>
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">With the certification in hand and a capstone project to showcase, the final phase is about professional readiness. I’ll be completely revamping my **resume and LinkedIn profile** to highlight my new skills and projects. A big part of this will be **interview preparation**, networking, and actively applying for jobs. I'll also explore small freelance opportunities and continue to improve my projects based on feedback.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Why I'm Sharing This Journey</h2>

            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">Every week, I'll be posting updates on my progress. I’ll share what I've learned, what challenges I've faced, and what I've built. I believe the best way to learn is by doing, and by documenting, I hope to create a resource that helps others on a similar path.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-400">This isn't just a plan; it's a commitment. I'm excited to share my progress with you and build something truly unique. Stay tuned for my first weekly update!</p>
